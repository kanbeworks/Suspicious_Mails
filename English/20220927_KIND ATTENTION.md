Greetings!

My name is Mr. Moon Jang,I am contacting you to receive and share with me 
an abandoned fund (TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
US DOLLARS) left in our bank, where I work by a deceased customer. 

I want to utilize this opportunity and make use of this fund, if I should 
present your name to the bank to stand as his business associate/ trustee 
for the fund to be released to you via Visa card for easy withdrawals in any 
VISA ATM machine anywhere in the World.

The bank will also give you international online transfer options. With these 
you can transfer the funds without any risk,as I will work with you as an insider 
to make this happen.

Should you be interested in working with me on this project, Please reply 
to my email so that i can provide further details on how we can get this done 
swiftly.

 



Best regards,

Mr. Moon Jang.
