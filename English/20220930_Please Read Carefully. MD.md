Good day,

I hope with this explanation you will understand better my purpose of 
contacting you. Please read carefully and patiently.

In June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 
36 calendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am 
head of accounts department.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder 
and finally discovered from his contract employers that he and his family 
died in a plane crash.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL 
and all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never 
successful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that 
he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents 
in his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.

His money (US$35,500,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity 
and all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to 
our banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money 
will be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.

It's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal 
to you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim 
the money so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary 
documents together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be 
paid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus 
to locate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid 
to him or her, but still no success.

If you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal, 
we shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this deal 
is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a professional 
in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth

If you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest 
upon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Jean-Jacque Kwame
