I am CARMEN BRANT, Inspection Unit Manager, United Nations Inspection 
Agency in Hartsfield Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through 
a diplomat from the United Kingdom, which was transferred from JF Kennedy 
Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, the two consignment boxes are 
worth $ 8 million. I ascertain to you that the consignment is in your name, 
you are therefore advised to provide clearance and yellow tag certificate 
for your claim.

I anticipate your email (carmenbrantm[at]gmail.com)


Best Regards,

Carmen Brant
INSPECTION OFFICER
